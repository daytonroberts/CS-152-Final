<h>Analyzing Fitness Supplements</h>

<p>I wanted to analyze data on fitness supplements so I found this data set on kaggle which had a vast variety of types of supplements from protein to BCAA's and all of their ingredients. I cut the data set down because most of the information wasn't helpful as a lot of the ingredients were blends of vitamins and minerals pertaining to one or few brands, which made it difficult to draw general conclusions about it.</p>

<h1>Do some products have a better bang for their buck?</h1>

<p>In order to check different product's bang for buck we need to establish what bang for buck means in terms of our variables. A good metric for the amount of a product is servings, because when you boil it down the number of servings is the number of times you can "use" a product.</p>
<p>Now the saying bang for buck (BFB) refers to how much money you spend to get a certain amount of something. If you spend a lot of money but get little of something the BFB is low, and when you spend little money but get a lot of something BFB is high, so basically the inverse of price per serving.</p>

<pre><code>
import seaborn as sb
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

supps = pd.read_csv("supplements.csv")
supps = supps.dropna()
supps = supps[supps['Category'].isin(['WHEY PROTEIN', 'WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE'])]

sp = sb.lmplot(data = supps, x = "Price", y = "PricePerServing")</pre></code>

<p> In this lm plot of price per serving as a function of price we see that as price increases
