<h1 id="preamble">Analyzing Fitness Supplements</h1>

<p>I wanted to analyze data on fitness supplements so I found this data set on kaggle which had a vast variety of types of supplements from protein to BCAA's and all of their ingredients. I cut the data set down because most of the information wasn't helpful as a lot of the ingredients were blends of vitamins and minerals pertaining to one or few brands, which made it difficult to draw general conclusions about it.
</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<center>
	<p>Question 1: Do some products have a better bang for their buck?</p>
	<p>Question 2: Does the advertised amount of protein have an effect on rating?</p>

<h2 >Question 1</h2>

<p>In order to check different product's bang for buck we need to establish what bang for buck means in terms of our variables. A good metric for the amount of a product is servings, because when you boil it down the number of servings is the number of times you can "use" a product.</p>
<p>Now the saying bang for buck (BFB) refers to how much money you spend to get a certain amount of something. If you spend a lot of money but get little of something the BFB is low, and when you spend little money but get a lot of something BFB is high, so basically the inverse of price per serving.</p>
